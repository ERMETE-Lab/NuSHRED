# Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Nuclear Reactors applications (NuSHRED)

This repository collects the codes regarding the application of the **Shallow REcurrent Decoder** (SHRED) method to **Nuclear Reactors** systems.

In particular, this repository serves as complementary code to the following paper:

- S. Riva, C. Introini, A. Cammi, and J. N. Kutz, “Robust State Estimation from Partial Out-Core Measurements with Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Nuclear Reactors,” [ArXiV](arxiv.com), 2024.

The simulation data (compressed) are available on Zenodo:

- Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) in the accidental scenario Unprotected Loss Of Fuel Flow (ULOFF): [compressed data](zenodo.org)

The SHRED method was first proposed and developed in this paper:

J. Williams, O. Zahn and J. N. Kutz, Sensing with shallow recurrent decoder networks, arxiv (2023) arXiv:2301.12011
