# P1: Robust State Estimation from Partial Out-Core Measurements with Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Nuclear Reactors

This folder collects the supporting notebooks of the following paper:

- Riva, S., Introini, C., Cammi, A., & Kutz, J. N. (2024). Robust State Estimation from Partial Out-Core Measurements with Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Nuclear Reactors. arXiv [Physics.Ins-Det]. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12550

On [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13789585), the simulation data (compressed) are available: this are needed to execute the notebook `01b_compute_measures.ipynb`.
`01a_svd.ipynb` requires the raw data and it is reported as complementary code, since we cannot share the raw data. In case of interest, please contact antonio.cammi@polimi.it.

The notebook `02a_shred_uq.ipynb` is the key file supporting the paper, in which the SHRED method is applied to the MSFR-ULOFF dataset.
