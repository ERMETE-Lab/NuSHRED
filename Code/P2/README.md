# P2: Towards Efficient Parametric State Estimation in Circulating Fuel Reactors with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks

This folder collects the supporting notebooks of the following paper:

- S. Riva, C. Introini, J. N. Kutz and A. Cammi, “Towards Efficient State Estimation in
Circulating Fuel Reactors with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks,” 2025. preprint available at
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904](arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904).

On [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15015236), the simulation data (compressed) are available.

In case interested to the raw data, please contact antonio.cammi@polimi.it.

The notebook `01_svd.ipynb` is a preliminary analysis of the dataset through the Singular Value Decomposition. The notebook `02_shred_outcore.ipynb` is the key file supporting the paper, in which the SHRED method is applied to the parametric MSFR-ULOFF dataset (D2).
